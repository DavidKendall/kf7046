# Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:

* learn how to install a server that supports ssh
* learn how to use a terminal interface to login into your server remotely, using ssh
* learn how to configure a static IP address and how to change the MAC address of a VM
* learn the location and purpose of Linux network configuration files

# Instructions

1. Make sure that your PC is running Ubuntu, is connected to the CNT network and that the network interface can be configured by the DHCP server. See the CNT Student Guide if you need help with this.
2. Ensure that you have a copy of the Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (64-bit) ISO image in your filespace (ask your lab tutor if you are unsure where to find it). <br/>
Follow the instructions in the [Virtualbox manual](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#idp9019728) to create a virtual machine.
**Notes**
<br/>
    * Use your username followed by "-s01" as the name of your machine, e.g. cgdk2-s01. Type should be Linux and Version should be Ubuntu.
    * Accept the defaults for memory size, hard drive size, hard drive file type, storage on physical hard drive and file storage location.
    * Start your new VM and browse to find the ISO image for your OS. Click Start.
    * Wait while your OS starts to boot and then choose the Install Ubuntu option.
    * Make progress by continuing to accept the defaults until prompted for location. Choose United Kingdom. Continue to accept the defaults until prompted for hostname. Enter the name of your VM, e.g. cgdk2-s01. Choose student and northumbria as your username and password. Continue to make progress by accepting the defaults until prompted to respond to Write the changes to disks and configure LVM?. Choose Yes. Accept the defaults until Write the changes to disks?. Choose Yes. Wait while the base system is installed. No http proxy is needed. Wait while apt and other software is installed. At Software selection, choose OpenSSH and continue with the defaults.
    * When you reach the Login prompt, use the VMM to perform an ACPI shutdown. Change the network settings so that Network Adapter 1 is configured as follows:

   ```
   Enable Network Adapter : Yes
   Attached to            : Bridged Adapter
   Name                   : eth1
   Adapter Type           : Paravirtualized Network (virtio-net)
   Promiscuous Mode       : Allow All
   MAC Address            : default ok
   Cable connected        : Yes
   ```

    * Restart your server and login. Use ifconfig -a to discover the network configuration details allocated by DHCP. Make a note of the IP address: a.b.c.d
    * Take a snapshot of your VM.
    * Close your desktop VM and reconfigure its network adapter 1 in the same way as for your server above. Restart your desktop VM, open a terminal window and execute the command:

   ``` shell_session  
   $ ssh student@a.b.c.d
   ```
   
    * Accept the certificate. Enter your credentials to login. You should now be logged into your headless server from your desktop VM. You will manage your server from this console window in future.
    * Occasionally, it is useful to be able to change the virtual MAC address of a VM (notice you can change the virtual MAC address of a VM network adapter from the Details window in your VMM by selecting Network -> Adapter n -> Advanced -> MAC address). However, by default, the network interfaces of an Ubuntu server are bound to their original MAC addresses. This binding is established in the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules. Edit this file and delete the lines that establish the MAC address binding for your network interface (eth0 -- notice that although your physical network interface is eth1, your virtual network interface is eth0), e.g.

   ``` shell_session
   $ sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
   ```

    * The network configuration of a server is usually assigned statically rather than by DHCP. The main network configuration file is /etc/network/interfaces. Edit this file to give static configurations for the:
        + IP address
        + Netmask
        + Gateway, and
        +DNS servers
    * You can use the values that have already been assigned via DHCP. You can find out the values for (a) and (b) with the ifconfig command, for (c) with the route command and for (d) by looking at the file /etc/resolv.conf.

    * After editing, the entry for eth0 in your /etc/network/interfaces file might look like the following:

   ```
   iface eth0 inet static
   address 192.168.3.3
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 192.168.3.1
   dns-nameservers 192.168.3.45 192.168.8.10
   dns-search foo.org bar.com
   ```

    * N.B. This is an example only. You'll need to use the values that you discovered above.
    * Halt your server:

   ```
   $ sudo shutdown -h now
   ```
    * Assign a new random MAC address to network adapter 1 and restart your server. Check that you can still login to your server from your desktop VM:

   ```
   $ ssh student@a.b.c.d
   ```
and test that it's connected to the Internet, e.g.

   ```
   $ wget -O - http://www.google.com
   ```
    * Install wireshark in your desktop VM:

   ```
   $ sudo apt-get install wireshark
   ```
Reconfigure it according to the instructions at the bottom of the page for Lab 1. Start it from your terminal with:
   
   ```
   $ wireshark 2>/dev/null &
   ```
Check that you can use it to observe network packets passing between your desktop VM, server VM and host OS (log in and out, use the ping and wget commands etc.).
You can reinforce and extend what you've learned about configuring the network adapter of a VM by reading the virtual networking chapter in the Virtualbox manual.
Use the man command to extend your understanding of the following commands: sudo, ifconfig, route, ping, wget, shutdown, nano, apt-get.

Note:
<br/>
Make sure that you have a copy of your VM before you leave the lab. If you need to save it to a portable storage device, it's probably simplest to use "File -> Export Appliance". Accept the defaults except for "File" when you should "Choose" your portable storage device.
