## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:
* Learn the basic commands of the Mininet network emulator
* Complete the introductory Mininet walkthrough.

## Instructions


1. Download the Mininet VM (**mininet-vm.ova**) from the local CIS storage (your lab tutor will
give you a URL). Import the VM into Oracle Virtualbox (**File -> Import Appliance**).

<!--
<li>
Before starting the VM, configure the network settings for your
environment. Change the name of the adapter to your physical <em>eth</em> adapter. In the <em>Advanced</em> section, randomly reconfigure the MAC address.
</li>
-->

1. Before starting the VM, ensure that your Virtualbox is configured to
allow host-only networking. Choose **File -> Preferences ->
Network** and check that **vboxnet0** appears in
your list of Host-only Networks (if not, add it).

1. Start the VM and log in, as follows:

     ```sh
     mininet-vm login: mininet
     Password: mininet
     ```

1. Discover the IP address of the *eth0* interface:

     ```sh
     $ ifconfig eth0
     ```
Make a note of the IP address and exit from the VM:

     ```sh
     $ exit
     ```

1. Start a console window in your host OS and ssh into your VM, using the IP address that you noted above, e.g.:

     ```sh
     $ ssh -Y mininet@192.168.56.101
     ```

1. Follow the instructions in the <a href="http://mininet.github.com/walkthrough/">Mininet walkthrough</a>

**Notes**
* When starting <em>wireshark</em>, you can safely ignore the following error:
     ```
     Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
     ```
* There's a nice article on Linux namespaces <a href="https://eos.aristanetworks.com/2011/06/linux-namespaces-at-arista/">here</a>.
