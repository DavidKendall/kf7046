# Introduction

Semaphores provide a powerful mechanism for managing concurrency but they are
also easy to misuse. *Monitors* offer a more disciplined approach to the
management of concurrency and are now widely recommended as the best approach
for the development of low-level concurrent programs. This lab deals with 
features of the `pthreads` library that support the development of 
monitors in the C programming language. Java provides very similar support for
concurrency through the use of `synchronized` methods.

# In the lab

1. Clone the `git` repository for this lab and build and
run the program by executing the following
commands:

   ``` shell_session 
   $ git clone https://github.com/DavidKendall/kf5010_L09
   $ cd kf5010_L09
   $ gcc -Wall -c buffer.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o bb -pthread main.c buffer.o -lm
   $ ./bb
   ``` 
Observe
its behaviour. This is a program that illustrates the use of a bounded
buffer, implemented as a monitor using locks and condition variables. Study
the code. 
The `main` function in `main.c` is intended to make use of the buffer to
illustrate its behaviour. It creates a number of *producer* threads and
a number of *consumer* threads. Each producer thread repeatedly creates
a message, puts it into the buffer and then waits for some random length of time.
Each message consists of the *id* of the thread and an integer value, 
also generated randomly. Each consumer thread gets a message from the buffer
and then waits for some random length of time. The state of the buffer is
shown at each stage using the `safe_buffer_print` function. For example,

   ```
   ||
   ||07, 077||
   ||07, 077||00, 039||
   ||07, 077||00, 039||02, 014||
   ||07, 077||00, 039||02, 014||09, 092||
   ```
shows an empty buffer, followed by a buffer with one message generated by thread
`07` containing the data `077`, followed by a buffer with two messages where the
second message was generated by thread `00` and contains the data `039`,
followed by a buffer with three messages where the third message was generated by
thread `02` and contains the data `014`, and so on. <br/>
Now pay attention to `buffer.h` and `buffer.c`. Answer the following questions.
    * How are the lock variables and condition variables declared?
    * What are the *private* variables that are protected by the use
of the monitor?
    * In the monitor functions `safe_buffer_put` and
`safe_buffer_get`, what are the first and last things to be done? What mechanism
is used to check the conditions in these functions? How is a thread suspended
if a condition is found to be false? What happens to the monitor lock when
a thread is suspended on a condition variable? When a thread resumes execution
following suspension, which thread holds the monitor lock?
    * How could we dispense with the need for the `safe_buffer_init` function
by using `PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER` and `PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER`? 
    * The functions `put_buffer` and `get_buffer` remain exposed in the header
file `buffer.h`. What is wrong with this? How can you modify `buffer.h` and
`buffer.c` to hide these functions?

1. A problem that often arises when working with programs that create multiple
   threads is that the threads that are created early in the creation process
   may begin to run before all of the other threads have been created.  This
   can lead to unexpected and/or unintended behaviour. A synchronisation
   mechanism that allows this behaviour to be eliminated is the *barrier*
   (barriers have many other uses as well but this is one of the simplest).  A
   barrier acts as a synchronisation point. When the barrier is initialised it
   is specified how many threads must reach the synchronisation point before
   any of them is allowed to continue. A thread that *waits* at a barrier will
   be blocked until the specified number of threads has reached the barrier.
   At this point, all waiting threads will be allowed to proceed (i.e. will be
   allowed through the barrier). The `pthreads` library provides excellent
   support for the use of barriers ([this
   guide](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-5137/gfwek/index.html) gives
   a brief introduction to barrier synchronisation with `pthreads`, also see
   the man pages for [pthread_barrier_init(),
   pthread_barrier_destroy()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_barrier_destroy.html),
   and
   [pthread_barrier_wait()](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_barrier_wait.html)).
   Now modify `main.c` so that all producer and consumer threads wait (using a
   barrier) until all threads have been created, before beginning to produce or
   consume.

1. The bounded buffer program that you are working with has been used with
hundreds of students over the last few years, and yet it contains a nasty bug
that, so far, nobody has pointed out. Run the program again and page through the
output. You may see some output similar to the following:

   ```
   ||05, 024||
   ||05, 024||08, 029||
   ||
   ||
   ||06, 051||
   ```
The lines marked `||` indicate that the buffer is empty at this point. But
the contents of the buffer are printed only following a `put` operation or
a `get` operation. If the buffer is empty then, after the next `put` operation,
it should have a message in it. And, clearly, if the buffer is empty the
next operation cannot possibly be a `get`. So, how is it possible to have
two or more consecutive lines of output indicating an empty buffer? This
is a bug. Examine the code in `main.c` where the buffer contents are printed.
Can you figure out how this bug occurs? Discuss this with your lab tutor if
necessary. (Hint: it's similar to the problem that we saw using
`lcd_set_pos()` followed by `lcd_write()`). Fix this bug by
implementing `safe_put_buffer_print()` and `safe_get_buffer_print()` functions.
Modify `buffer.h` and `buffer.c` as necessary. Modify `main.c` to use these
new functions. Build and test your program. You should find that the bug
is now fixed.

1. In lecture [B07]({{site.raurl}}/B07.pdf), you saw a sketch of a solution
to the readers/writers problem using semaphores. Create a monitor using
`pthreads` mutexes and condition variables to solve the same problem. Note
your program should not make use of semaphores. The structure of your 
`readers_writers.h` and `readers_writers.c` files will be similar to 
`buffer.h` and `buffer.c`. 

1. If you are feeling ambitious, modify your `readers_writers` monitor so
that it avoids the problem of reader starvation that was identified in the
lecture.
