# Introduction

This lab encourages you to develop your understanding of deadlock and starvation 
as they might arise in the development of concurrent systems.

# In the lab

1. Make sure that you are up to date with the exercises from previous weeks.

1. Clone the git repository for the lab. Build and run the program.

   ``` shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/davidkendall/kf5010_L10
   $ cd kf5010_L10
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o count_semaphore -pthread count_semaphore.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./count_semaphore
   ```
Observe the behaviour of the program. You should see that it displays two counters
that increment for a while and then stop. The counting stops because of a deadlock.
The thinking behind the design of the program is that there are two main 
resources: the shared variables that store the counts and the total; and the LCD
display. The programmer has introduced a semaphore to manage access to each 
resource. Study the code carefully. Answer the following questions:
    1. What are the four conditions required for deadlock in a concurrent program?
    1. For each of those four conditions, which feature of this program ensures
that the condition is satisfied.
    1. Which of the four conditions is it easiest to break in this example?

1. Fix the program so that it no longer deadlocks. Preserve the use of both
   semaphores and make the minimum changes necessary to remove the deadlock.

1. Suggest an experiment that would allow you to explore the occurrence of
   starvation in the readers/writers solution that was given in the last lab.
   Discuss your proposal with the lab tutor.

1. Continue to make progress with the assignment.
