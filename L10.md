## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:
* Get more practice with Mininet.
* Use Mininet to explore the behaviour of TCP, in particular its behaviour
   when the network is congested.

## Instructions


1. This lab assumes that you have downloaded the Mininet VM
   (**mininet-vm.ova**) from the local CIS storage,
   imported the VM into Oracle Virtualbox (**File -> Import
   Appliance**), configured the network settings and can start the
   VM. Refer to last week's lab instructions if you have not done this.

1. Before starting the VM, ensure that your Virtualbox is configured to
allow host-only networking. Choose **File -> Preferences ->
Network** and check that **vboxnet0** appears in
your list of Host-only Networks (if not, add it).

1. Start the VM and log in, as follows:

     ```sh
     mininet-vm login: mininet
     Password: mininet
     ```

1. Discover the IP address of the *eth0* interface:

     ```sh
     $ ifconfig eth0
     ```
   Make a note of the IP address and exit from the VM:

     ```sh
     $ exit
     ```

1. Start a console window in your host OS and ssh into your VM, using the IP address that you noted above, e.g.:

     ```sh
     $ ssh -Y mininet@192.168.56.101
     ```

1. Download [topo_sw2_host4]({{site.baseurl}}{{site.raurl}}/topo_sw2_host4.py) into the **mininet/custom** directory of your VM. 

     ```
     vm:~$ cd mininet/custom
     vm:~$ wget http://computing.northumbria.ac.uk/staff/cgdk2/Teaching/EN746/topo_sw2_host4.py
     vm:~$ cd
     ```

   This topology file specifies a topology with
   2 switches and 4 hosts, configured as follows:

     ```
          h1           h2
           \           /
           s1---------s2
           /           \
          h3           h4
     ```
1. Test this topology by loading it (assigning a capacity of 10 Mb/s to each link) and running an all-pairs ping test:

     ```
     vm:~$ sudo mn --custom ~/mininet/custom/topo_sw2_host4.py --topo sw2host4 --link tc,bw=10 --test pingall
     ```
   Check that the test was successful (*Results: 0% dropped*). 

1. Start the Mininet CLI with the custom topology and start an **xterm** in each host:

     ```
     vm:~$ sudo mn --custom ~/mininet/custom/topo_sw2_host4.py --topo sw2host4 --link tc,bw=10 

     mininet> xterm h1 h2 h3 h4
     ```

1. Open a new console window in your host OS and ssh into your VM, e.g.:

     ```
     $ ssh -Y mininet@192.168.56.101

     ```
   Select *Reno* as the TCP congestion control algorithm:

     ```
     vm:~$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=reno
     ```
 
   Start *wireshark*:

     ```
     vm:~$ sudo wireshark &amp;
     ```
   and start a capture session on interface **s2-eth1**.


1. Start *iperf* servers in the xterms for h2 and h4. Get ready to
   start *iperf* clients in the xterms for h1 (client of h2) and
   h3 (client of h4). Configure your clients to run for 60 seconds. (Use
   the *man* command if you can't remember how to do this -
   *man iperf*). Start the *iperf* clients simultaneously
   (as close as you can manage). When both clients have finished, stop
   the *wireshark* capture session.


1. Explore the packet capture in *wireshark*:
   1. Identify the connection setup and teardown sequences.

   1. Determine when congestion is first detected and how long it takes to recover.

   1. Explore the *Statistics* options: conversations, TCP Streamgraph etc. 

   1. *Optional:* Have a look at the Python program that creates the
      custom topology. See if you can edit the program, so that it adds an
      additional host to each switch (hosts h5 and h6). Save your new
      program as **topo_sw2_host6.py**. Test your new topology as
      you did with **topo_sw2_host4.py** above.


**Notes**
* When starting *wireshark*, you can safely ignore the following error:
     ```
     Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"
     ```
