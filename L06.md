## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:

* Configure a reverse DNS zone on your primary DNS server for the 
  student.co.uk. domain
* Configure a secondary DNS server
* Observe and explain DNS load-balancing
* Enable logging on your DNS primary and secondary servers
* Use Wireshark to observe and analyse network traffic
* Observe and analyse logs

## Instructions

1. Configure your server VM to support a reverse zone for the student.co.uk. 
   uk domain that you created last week. Remember that the addresses that 
   you configured were as follows:

     ```
     a. 192.168.100.2                                www.student.co.uk
     b. 192.168.100.21                               rtlab1.student.co.uk
     c. <your client ip address>                     me.student.co.uk
     d. 192.168.100.1                                master.student.co.uk
     e. 192.168.100.2                                mail.student.co.uk
     f. 192.168.100.254                              gateway.student.co.uk
     ```
You need only configure a reverse mapping for the canonical names (the A records).  

1. Check the configuration file and the zone file before proceeding beyond this
   point. The command `named-checkconf` will check your configuration file for
   syntactic correctness. The command `named-checkzone` will check your zone file
   for syntactic correctness. **WARNING:** if a configuration file or a zone file
   is syntactically invalid, it will not be loaded when the bind9 service is
   started, and it may be the case that no error message is displayed. Example
   usage:

     ```sh
     $ named-checkconf /etc/bind/named.conf.local
     $ named-checkzone student.co.uk /etc/bind/db.student.co.uk
     ```

1. Use Wireshark to observe DNS traffic as you generate name searches. Make
   sure that you can explain the traffic that you observe.  

1. Create a new server VM (simplest to clone your existing server VM, change
   its hostname and MAC address) and configure it as a secondary server for
   your student.co.uk domain. 

1. DNS Load balancing

   * Now modify your student zone so that the www record has 3 IP Addresses 
     associated with it:

      1. 192.168.100.2
      1. 192.168.100.3
      1. 192.168.100.4

     Restart the bind9 service.
   * Repeatedly carry out a dig query for www.student.co.uk. Note the 
   difference in the results. Explain your observation.

1. Add a logging facility, so that all DNS queries are logged to the file
   `/var/log/named/query.log`. Follow the instructions from the lecture. The
   bind9 documentation has more details about the logging options, but the
   simple example of query logging in the lecture slides should be enough for
   your needs.
