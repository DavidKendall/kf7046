## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:

* Configure a reverse DNS zone for your student.co.uk. domain.
* Identify and explain the traffic generated by a reverse DNS lookup.
* Configure a secondary DNS server
* Observe and explain DNS load-balancing.

## Instructions

1. Configure your server VM to support a reverse zone for the student.co.uk. 
   uk domain that you created last week. Remember that the addresses that 
   you configured were as follows:

     ```
     a. 192.168.100.2                                www.student.co.uk
     b. 192.168.100.21                               rtlab1.student.co.uk
     c. <your client ip address>                     me.student.co.uk
     d. 192.168.100.1                                master.student.co.uk
     e. 192.168.100.2                                mail.student.co.uk
     f. 192.168.100.254                              gateway.student.co.uk
     ```
You need only configure a reverse mapping for the canonical names (the A records).  

1. Check the configuration file and the zone file before proceeding beyond this
   point. The command `named-checkconf` will check your configuration file for
   syntactic correctness. The command `named-checkzone` will check your zone file
   for syntactic correctness. **WARNING:** if a configuration file or a zone file
   is syntactically invalid, it will not be loaded when the bind9 service is
   started, and it may be the case that no error message is displayed. Example
   usage:

     ```sh
     $ named-checkconf /etc/bind/named.conf.local
     $ named-checkzone student.co.uk /etc/bind/db.student.co.uk
     ```

1. Use Wireshark to observe DNS traffic as you generate name searches. Make
   sure that you can explain the traffic that you observe.  

1. Create a new server VM (simplest to clone your existing server VM, change
   its hostname and MAC address) and configure it as a secondary server for
   your student.co.uk domain. 

1. DNS Load balancing

   * Now modify your student zone so that the www record has 3 IP Addresses 
     associated with it:

      1. 192.168.100.2
      1. 192.168.100.3
      1. 192.168.100.4

     Restart the bind9 service.
   * Repeatedly carry out a dig query for www.student.co.uk. Note the difference in the results. Explain your observation.
