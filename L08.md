# Introduction

An important data structure, used for a variety of purposes in an
operating system, is a *ring buffer* (this is a type of *bounded
buffer*, also known as a *circular buffer*). This data structure
was introduced in the lecture about the producer/consumer problem
([B07]({{site.raurl}}/B07.pdf)). This lab is concerned with the
implementation of a thread-safe ring buffer using semaphores and its
use in a simple application.

# In the lab

1. Clone the `git` repository for this lab and build and
run the program by executing the following
commands:

   ``` shell_session
   $ git clone https://github.com/DavidKendall/kf5010_L08
   $ cd kf5010_L08
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o leds -pthread leds.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./leds
   ```
Observe
its behaviour. This is a solution to exercise 6 from last week. Study
the code. In particular, you should pay attention to:
    * the declaration of the semaphore  `sem_t lcd_sem`
    * the use of `sem_init` to initialise the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_wait` to acquire the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_post` to release the semaphore

   Note how `lcd_sem` is used by the LED threads
   to ensure mutually exclusive access to the LCD. Identify the
   *entry protocol* and the *exit protocol* for the critical section in
   each of these threads.

1. Now checkout `P02`. Build and run the program as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ git checkout P02
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
You'll see a nasty mess in your console window. You can stop the program
by typing `Ctrl-C` and you can repair the terminal window, if necessary,
using the `reset` command. Next try building the program with `console_safe.o`,
as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -Wall -c console_safe.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd_with_interference.c console_safe.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
This time you'll see how the program is intended to run. It creates three
threads, each of which increments its own local counter, and prints the
value of the counter to the LCD. The LCD is a resource that is shared by all
three threads. As you have seen, the threads can interfere with each other
when using the LCD, unless precautions are taken to prevent it. The
`console_safe.c` program uses semaphores to prevent interference. An alternative
approach is to use a mutual exclusion semaphore inside `lcd.c`. Implement this
approach instead, based on what you have learned from studying the first
program in these exercises. Build and run your new program as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ gcc -Wall -o lcd -pthread lcd_with_interference.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./lcd
   ```
You should find that the program behaves properly without interference.

1. Rather than allowing all threads to write to the LCD and controlling
their use of the resource by having them all follow the mutual exclusion
protocol, it can be better to have a single thread (an LCD thread) that is
the only thread permitted to write to the LCD. Any other threads have only
indirect access to the LCD by sending a message containing their data to
the LCD thread, which is then responsible for displaying an appropriate
message. The exchange of data between the LCD thread and other threads can
be managed by using a *ring buffer*. Modify your program so that it
is implemented in this way. You'll need to do the following:

    1. Add an LCD thread to be responsible for managing the display.

    1. Add new files `buffer.h` and `buffer.c` to the project.
Implement the naive circular buffer that was
described in [lecture B07]({{site.raurl}}/B07.pdf).  Modify the
definition of the message type, `message_t`, so that it is suitable
for use in this application. You need fields in the structure to
identify the thread sending the message and to store the other data
that is being sent.

    1. The naive buffer has a number of potential problems:
interference between multiple producers or consumers; failure if a
producer attempts to put to a full buffer; and failure if a consumer
attempts to get from an empty buffer. Now implement 3 new functions,
`safe_buffer_init()`, `safe_buffer_put()` and
`safe_buffer_get()` to provide a solution to these problems,
as described in [lecture B07]({{site.raurl}}/B07.pdf) from the slide
*Elements of a solution* onwards. You'll need to decide on
appropriate parameters for these functions yourself. Use your naive
buffer functions to implement the operations to add and remove items
from the buffer. Modify your `buffer.h` and `buffer.c` files accordingly.

    1. Now modify your main program by:
* removing all synchronisation code - use of semaphores etc.
* modify your `count` threads so that, instead of writing to the LCD,
they send messages to the LCD thread reporting their `id` and `counter` value.
The job of
the LCD thread is to read these messages and update the LCD
accordingly. You should use your `safe_buffer` implementation
for passing messages between threads.

Ask your lab tutor for help in interpreting these instructions and
for guidance about your implementation.
