# Introduction

This lab is another that looks at the problems that can arise when tasks share
resources. This time the problems are tackled by using semaphores. We also
investigate further issues that can arise when developing programs for a
multi-processor environment.  The idea of speedup that was introduced last week
is developed further by looking at Amdahl's Law.

# In the lab

1. Make sure that you understand the solution to last week's
exercises. Checkout `P08` in the `kf5010_L06` repository. Make sure that
you understand `pi.c` completely. Ask your lab tutor for help if you
have any questions. Remind yourself of your experimental results from
last week. Was the multi-threaded program more efficient? What was the
speedup? This issue will be revisited at the end of the lab.

1. Clone the `git` repository for this lab. Build and run the
program as follows:

   ``` shell_session 
   $ git clone https://github.com/DavidKendall/kf5010_L07
   $ cd kf5010_L07
   $ gcc -Wall -c console.c
   $ gcc -Wall -o count_semaphore -pthread count_semaphore.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./count_semaphore
   ``` 
Observe its behaviour. Study the code. In particular, you should pay attention to:
    * the inclusion of `pthread.h` and `semaphore.h`
    * the declaration of the semaphore `static sem_t sem;`
    * the use of `sem_init` to initialise the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_wait` to acquire the semaphore
    * the use of `sem_post` to release the semaphore

   Notice how this program also solves the interference problem,
   just like Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm does, but this
   program does not have the busy waiting problem of Peterson's algorithm. 
   When a task is blocked, waiting for a semaphore, some other task gets
   a chance to run. This leads to much more efficient use of the CPU.

1. Compare the behaviour of `count_peterson` from `kf5010_L06:master` with
   `count_semaphore` from `kf5010_L07:master`. Do you notice any difference?
   You can be sure that there is no interference in either case (the LEDs don't
   start flashing) but if you look for long enough, you'll see that in the
   `count_peterson` case, the `count1` and `count2` threads make progress at
   exactly the same rate, whereas in the `count_semaphore` case, one of the
   `count` threads usually runs slightly ahead of the other `count` thread. How
   is this possible? Is this an error? Explain your answer. Modify the
   `count_semaphore.c` program so that both `count` threads make progress at
   the same rate (HINT: use 2 semaphores for signalling, instead of the mutual
   exclusion semaphore, and pay careful attention to the initialisation of
   their counters - see slides 12 and 13 in Lecture B, week 6 if you need
   further help). How confident are you that mutual exclusion is preserved?

1. Checkout `P04` which is the starting program for the next couple of
exercises in this session. Build and run the program as follows:

   ``` shell_session
   $ git checkout P04
   $ gcc -Wall -o leds -pthread leds.c console.o -lncursesw
   $ ./leds
   ```
You'll see that it is another program to flash some LEDS: LED_WHITE and
LED_RED. Initially the lights are off. You can start flashing LED_WHITE
by pressing the left arrow key. Similarly, you can start flashing LED_RED
by pressing the right arrow key. Actually, left arrow and right arrow act
as toggle switches: turn on if off; turn off if on. You can also adjust the rate
at which the lights flash. Up arrow / Down arrow to increase / decrease the
rate of LED_WHITE and Pg Up / Pg Dn to increase / decrease the rate of LED_RED.
Experiment with program and study the code carefully until you understand
how it works. Ask your lab tutor if you need some help.

1. Now modify your program so that each of the LED threads
reports its own status using the LCD. The thread should report whether or
not it is flashing and its current flashing delay, e.g.

    ```
    (LED1) F:ON  D:900000
    (LED2) F:OFF D:1500000
    ```

1. Experiment with the flashing delays of each of the LEDs. Do you
observe any interference between the LED threads when they are
using the LCD? Why does this occur?  Remember the LCD is now a shared
resource. Use a semaphore to provide mutually exclusive access to the
LCD, so that the interference is prevented. Comment on the
effectiveness of your solution. Once you have this working, take a close
look at the code in `console_safe.c`. It should be clear now how the
console operations have been made thread-safe. If you need further
explanation, ask your lab tutor.

1. Last week we considered the *speedup* of a multi-threaded program when
executed on a multi-processor computer. We saw a definition of 
speedup as the ratio of the execution time for a sequential program to the
execution time for a parallel program (to solve the same problem).
\\[ S = \frac{T_S}{T_P} \\]
In 1967, Gene Amdahl, a computer scientist working at IBM, provided a
theoretical analysis of what the limits of speedup might be for any given 
problem. Suppose that we have a sequential program that solves the problem
in 1 unit of time. Further suppose that the fraction of the problem that can
be solved in parallel is $$P$$ ($$0 \leq P \leq 1$$). Clearly, the fraction
of the problem that must still be solved sequentially is $$(1 - P)$$. If
we have $$N$$ processors available (and we can share the load of the parallel
part equally between them), then the time taken to execute the parallel part
is $$\frac{P}{N}$$ and, therefore, the time taken to solve the problem with
our parallel program, using $$N$$ processors, is $$(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}$$.
This gives a speedup with $$N$$ processors of 
\\[S_N \leq \frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{N}}\\]
Notice that this assumes that the overheads of parallelising the program are 
negligible. These include the time for thread creation and destruction etc. and
may be non-negligible in some cases. Amdahl's law gives an indication of 
the importance of that fraction of the program that is parallelisable in
comparison with the number of processors available. To get a feel for this,
calculate the maximum speedup $$S_N$$ that, according to Amdahl's law, would
be possible for the following values of $$N$$ and $$P$$:
    1. $$N = 500$$, $$P = 0.5$$
    2. $$N = 5000000$$, $$P = 0.5$$
    3. $$N = 5$$, $$P = 0.7$$
    4. $$N = 5$$, $$P = 0.9$$
    5. $$N = 500$$, $$P = 0.9$$
    6. $$N = 5000000$$, $$P = 0.9$$
    7. $$N = 5000000$$, $$P = 0.99$$

   Notice that, as $$N$$ becomes very large, $$\frac{P}{N}$$ tends to $$0$$ and,
   therefore, the speedup possible tends to $$\frac{1}{1 - P}$$.

1. Make sure that you understand the assignment specification
fully. Now is the time to ask your tutor to clarify any aspects of the
specification that you are unsure about.
