## Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:

* Investigate the use of MQTT for a simple IoT project

## Instructions

1. There is a good tutorial on getting started with MQTT at [Sending and
   receiving messages with
   MQTT](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/sending-and-receiving-messages-with-mqtt/)
   Read through this tutorial and have a go at following it in a desktop VM.
   **Note:** Just go as far as, but not including, the section called
   'A more practical example', since you don't have access to an EV3.

1. Generate some MQTT messages - publish some data and subscribe to it - then
   investigate what is transmitted using Wireshark. You could use a
   server VM to install and run a `mosquitto` server and a pair of desktop
   VMs, one acting as a publisher and the other acting as a subscriber.

Details about the [Eclipse
Mosquitto](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.mosquitto) project
and the [Eclipse Paho](https://eclipse.org/paho/) project are available.
