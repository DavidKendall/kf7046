# Introduction

Your aim in this lab is to:

* learn to use the iperf performance monitoring tool
* learn how to configure parameters in the Linux kernel that affect network performance
* perform some experiments to observe the effect of kernel parameters on network performance
* analyse and explain your experimental data

# Instructions

1. Make sure that your PC is running Ubuntu, is connected to the CNT network and that the network interface can be configured by the DHCP server. See the CNT Student Guide if you need help with this.
2. Ensure that the iperf program is installed on your host OS and also on your guest desktop and server VMs. If you need to install the program, you can do so with the command:

   ``` shell_session
   $ sudo apt-get install iperf
   ```
There is a [manual entry for iperf](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/iperf.1.html) (you can also use the man command). Steve Gordon has a nice [quick start guide](http://sandilands.info/sgordon/quick-start-guide-for-iperf-and-tc) to using iperf.
3. You should do this exercise, and subsequent exercises in this lab, with a partner, using 2 (actual) 
machines. Establish a direct (not through a switch) physical connection between your machines. Start an 
iperf server on one machine and an iperf client on the other machine. You should use the default values 
except you should vary the time for which the client transmits data (use the -t switch) starting from 10s 
and rising in 10s increments until the observed throughput reaches a maximum. Make a note of the experimental 
conditions and the results.
4. Repeat the previous experiment, except this time your machines should be connected through a switch. Note any differences that you observe in the results.
5. Repeat the previous experiment, except this time you should run your iperf client and server in VMs running on each of your physical machines. Try this for VMs using para-virtualised network interfaces and also Intel Pro 1000/MT Desktop (82540EM) interfaces. Note the results and compare with previous results.
6. Use the iperf reference material to learn about the use of the -w option to control the receive buffer size (on your server). Then repeat the previous experiment using the maximum time, noted in the last exercise, for each run, with a range of receive buffer sizes. Start at the minimum buffer size and increase by doubling each time; continue until your results converge.
7. Use *ping* to discover RTT for messages in previous configuration. Can you propose a relationship between RTT, bandwidth and receive buffer size?
