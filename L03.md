# Introduction

This lab is based on the material in
[B02]({{site.raurl}}/B02.pdf).  It is intended to give you
some practice in writing simple shell scripts. You should refer
to [The Linux Command Line]({{site.raurl}}/TLCL.pdf)

# Exercises

1. Work through [these shell scripting
   notes]({{site.raurl}}/shell_scripting.pdf). 
   This is not just a reading exercise. You'll need to be working with
   a Unix system, with a text editor and a command line terminal open.
   Try out everything as you work through. Enter scripts into the editor,
   save them in a well-named text file, make the file executable and run the
   script from the command line. Observe the results. 

# Additional exercises

1. Write a script to *copy* each file in the working folder with a name ending
   `.doc` to a subfolder called `docs`, and each file in the working folder
   with a name ending `.txt` to a subfolder called `txt`. Test your script on
   a folder populated with some suitable files.

2. Write a script similar to the one above, except that the working directory
   path is given as a run-time argument.

3. Write a script similar to the one above, but which additionally tests for
   the existence of the subdirectories, creating them if they don't exist and
   clearing them of all contents if they do exist. Modify this script so that
   it prompts the user for a yes/no answer, to a question about whether the
   contents should be deleted or not, in the case that the target directories
   exist already. The script should behave according to the user response.
